The proposed “Krishi_Margadarshak” leverages historical data and advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze various factors, including weather conditions and soil quality, to predict crop yields for a given season. This system empowers farmers to make informed decisions regarding crop selection and planting schedules, ultimately leading to increased productivity and a reduced risk of crop failure. In addition to crop recommendation, the system includes a comprehensive disease prediction and management module. It detects potential diseases that could affect the recommended crops and provides actionable solutions for managing and treating these diseases. Specific pesticides are also recommended for efficient disease control, ensuring crop health and safety.
